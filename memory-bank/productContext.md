# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
Traditional barbershop booking is inefficient — phone calls, walk-ins with long waits, or clunky third-party booking systems. This funnel provides a seamless, premium booking experience directly on SNNAKE Barbershop's website in Царево.

## Problems It Solves
1. **For Clients:** Eliminates waiting in line; book in 30 seconds from anywhere
2. **For Barbers:** Clear schedule visibility, no double-bookings, easy availability management
3. **For the Business:** Higher conversion rates, professional brand image, data collection

## How It Should Work
- Landing page hooks visitors with premium visuals and social proof
- Multi-step booking form guides them through service → barber → time → details
- Admin dashboard allows staff to manage all appointments and block time off

## User Experience Goals
- **Speed:** Complete booking in under 30 seconds
- **Trust:** Social proof (testimonials, ratings) builds confidence
- **Premium Feel:** Dark/gold theme, smooth animations, high contrast
- **Mobile-First:** Optimized for thumb-zone interaction on phones
